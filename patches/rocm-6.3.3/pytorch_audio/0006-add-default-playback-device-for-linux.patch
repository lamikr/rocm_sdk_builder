Subject: [PATCH 6/9] add default playback device for linux

- try to use the pulse-audio as a default audio device
  on linux instead of just directly drowing exception
  if target device is not specified.
- code will still check whether the pulse-audio is available
  so the code will still work like earlier if pulse is not available
  as a target device.
- Tested on fedora 40 which actually uses the pipewire while still
  providing the pulse as a target device
