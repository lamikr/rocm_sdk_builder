Subject: [PATCH 4/5] AMDMIGraphX msgpack-cxx ubuntu 24.04 search fix

Ubuntu 24.04 has renamed msgpackc-cxx to
msgpack-cxx and AMDMIGraphX configure failed to
find it and eventually failed on linking phase.
(msgpack itself was found but not -cxx extensions)

Fix by searching first the msgpackc-cxx and if that
fails search the msgpack-cxx
