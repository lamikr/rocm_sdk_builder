    - pytorch v2.3.1
    - pytorch vision v0.18.1
    - pytorch audio v2.3.1
    - onnxruntime 1.18.0
    - DeepSpeed v0.14.3
    - zstd v1.5.5
- Build System Improvements
    - more heuristic approach for defining the CPU count used for building different apps
      depending of the CPU count and ram available.
      (To avoid running out of memory on some extensive apps like the llvm linking phase)
    - Build now checks and warns more clearly if the git configuration
      is missing or if the read-write permission to amd gpu driver
      /dev/kfd is not configured properly.
    - Lot of improvements to error messages, code comments and bash code syntax used
    - Fixes for the onnxruntime and deepspeed build
    - Aotriton cpu usage fixes (allocated 2x cpus available and put build systems down)
    - Aotriton workaround for issue wheer triton compiler not always producing .hsaco files (issue 28)
    - Upstream bug repors and fixes (rocm_smi_lib, pytorch)
- test apps, documentation and benchmarking
    - Improved various example codes under docs/examples folder to test
      pytorch, opencl, onnxruntime, amdmigraphx, etc.
    - added missing test apps launch scripts
    - pytorch gpu benchmark tests execution improvements in
      https://github.com/lamikr/pytorch-gpu-benchmark
