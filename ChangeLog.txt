# ROCM SDK Builder 6.1.2 (2025-03-05)
-------------------------------------

- ROCM SDK Builder 6.1.2 is based on to ROCM 6.1.2, Python 3.11 and Pytorch 2.4.1 and 
- pre-built docker images available for testing
  https://hub.docker.com/r/lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder/tags
  Full installation and usage instructions are provided on the ROCM SDK Builders github page.
- expanded list of supported GPUs tested
  - community around the ROCM SDK builder has helped to test a broad range of AMD consumer GPUs
  - RDNA1/RDNA2/RDNA3 discrete GPUs (AMD 5600 - 7900 XTX)
  - CDNA based GPUs (AMD Radeon VII and MI50)
  - RX 7700S discrete GPU on Framework laptop (gfx1102)
  - iGPUs like AMD 680M/780M/880M/Strix Point/Strix Halo
- build support for never enterprice level GPUs exist but they have not yet been tested by the ROCM SDK Builder project
  - MI100, MI210, MI250 and MI300  
- improved ML model performance with many GPUs
    GPU specific tuning has been added for many older GPUs in projects like rocBLAS and Aotriton to increase their performance. 
    (Thank you for the upstream ROCM Projects for providing a mechanism to add tuning data for additional GPUs)
- various new example and test applications for different ML applications
  - small test and example applications for various tools can be found from
    /opt/rocm/docs/examples folder
  - bigger example applications to show the usage of LLAMA, stable diffusion, pytorch audio and LLM models
- extended Linux distribution support: The list of supported Linux distributions for building the project has significantly expanded.
- improved benchmarking
  - simple benchmark to compare the CPU and GPU performance
    /opt/rocm_sdk_612/benchmark to allow executing
  - pytorch gpu benchmark to compare different GPU models
    https://github.com/lamikr/pytorch-gpu-benchmark
    It will also allow generating graph diagrams to compare benchmark results between selected GPUs.
    (source code needs to be edited in current version to select which GPU result filed are compared)
- support for third party machine learning applications via new Extra-applicatioins layer 
    Applications are now divided to mandatory Core applications and non-mandatory Extra applications.
    Lot of applications have been now added to the list of supported optional extra applications.
    Extra applications are not build by default but can be build easily after the ROCM SDK Builder
    has finished building the mandatory core applications.
  - Core Applications (built by default)
    - Includes AMD ROCm stack, and base machine learning tools like PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and DeepSeed.
  - Extra Applications (can be built separately)  
    - `ai_tools`: Llama.cpp, vLLM, Stable Diffusion (web UI), CTranslate2, etc.
    - `google-tools`: JAX
    - `amd-media-tools`: rocDecode, RPP, MIVisionX
    - `amd_devel_tools`: rocProfiler, OmniTracer, and their dependencies
    - `amd-aie`: LLVM for XDNA/XDNA2 NPU (integrates the aie-llvm toolchain to /opt/rocm_sdk_612/apps/aie subdirectory)
- configure options under rocm_sdk/etc to allow rocm sdk specific versions of some tools to have separate configuration options
  compared to distro versions of same applications
   - slurm: /opt/rocm_sdk_xyz/etc/slurm folder (contains also configure examples for running nodes either on 1 or 2 computers)
   - OpenCL: OpenCL Vendor specific amdocl.icd and xilinx.icd are installed and configured to be searched from /opt/rocm_sdk_xyz/etc/OpenCL
- LLVM for XDNA and XDNA2 NPUs:
  The ROCM SDK Builder can now be used to build an LLVM compiler for AMD's VLIW instruction-based XDNA and XDNA2 NPUs.
  Simple test application with instructions for building and executing it is included.
- fixes and new features in babs.sh build tool
  - re-organization and language fixes, thank you for the contributions
  - added lot of new commands and improved the functionality to allow updating the system more easily by re-building only the changed applications
- build process fixes for many applications
  - `rocorofiler` and `rocTracer` dependencies are now built only once separately instead of building them as a part of these tools own build process.
     (for example timemory) 
  - onnxruntime and deepspeed:
    Allow configuring the target GPU list without requirement to really have the GPU on the build machine.
    (Target GPU can be given as a parameter instead of build system checking what GPUs are present)
  - AOTriton 
    GPU specific files generated and build will now be stored for own dedicatd directory for each GPUs.
    This fixes inode resource problems breaking the build if too manyGPUs are selected as a build target simultaneously.
  - stable-diffusion-webui
    Disabled the automatic update mechanism possibly fetching the source code to newer version during the build time. 
  - VLLM
    flash attention support added for MI50/Radeon VII (never AMD GPUs already supported by default)
- Stats
  - 100 pull request, over 80 closed bugs

## Known Issues
-  RDNA1 based RX 5700 and V520 GPU (gfx1010 and gfx1011) can randomly hang when executing ML tasks
  - problem can be triggered by executing pytorch gpu benchmark: 
       https://github.com/lamikr/pytorch-gpu-benchmark
  - work-around patch exist for the kernel which disables the workque disable and resume triggered by the
    MMU events for the kernel when new task is loaded. Real fix seems to require patching the firmware
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241127114638.11216-1-lamikr@gmail.com/T/#mb4da09bc8b7c87eb56796631e3d0b08063e73347
  - only way to recovery fully requires the power on/power of cycle for the PC. (PC reboot usually hangs)
-  RDNA3 based gfx1103 M680 iGPU can randomly crash while executing ML tasks
  - this problem can be triggered with example application available on 
    https://github.com/lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder/issues/141#issuecomment-2344985438
  - work-around patch exist for the kernel which disables the workque disable and resume triggered by the
    MMU events for the kernel when new task is loaded. Real fix seems to require patching the firmware
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241127114638.11216-1-lamikr@gmail.com/T/#mb4da09bc8b7c87eb56796631e3d0b08063e73347
  - unlike the RX 5700 crash, this failure does not require a full reboot
- it is possible to build the release on Windows WSL2 environment but it's unclear is it possible to get the
  reguired AMD GPU Windows driver to work with the version build on that way

## Plans for the Next Release
- Update many applications to newer versions: The next release will update many applications to newer versions.
- Add support for new Extra applications: InstructLab and Shark will requires newer ROCM base before they can be integrated to ROCM SDK build
